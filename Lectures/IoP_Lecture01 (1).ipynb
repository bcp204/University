    "Python is a computer language. Most computer langauges have some resemblance to human language but they are very fussy! Every punctuation must be correct, every space has to be in place, every word has to have the correct capitalisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Language tends to have a notion of __nouns__ and __verbs__. Python has a similar notion of __objects__ and __functions/methods__. Functions are the ways that we do things in python. They are like the verbs. For example: \n",
    "\n",

    "print(\"Hello world!\") \n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case:\n",
    "- ```print``` is the function. \n",
    "- ```()``` contains what gets done. \n",
    "- ```\"Hello world!\"``` is data to which we do something, in this case, we __print__ the characters between the quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic types of data in python, __primitive__ data types and __object__ data types. Primitives are the basic buiding blocks of more complex data structures, much like how letters are the building blocks of words and digits the building blocks of numbers. For example, each letter is a primitive data type in python called a __character__. An ordered list of characters is called a __string__ object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most objects you do not want to type out in full every time. For this reason we use labels as shortcuts. These labels are called __variables__. You assign a value to a variable and then you can use that variable to 'represent' the value. See how this works below:"

This encoding had 128 characters including basic white space, punctuation, A-Z in upper and lower case, digits and a few system characters. This was later expanded to latin-1, which includes most characters derived in latin languages with accents and diacritics. But nowaways, many programs use Unicode. Where ASCII was stored in a single byte (this is a byte: 0000 0001, it's 8-bits though ASCII only needed 7 bits). By contrast, Unicode can have sepcific code points in a variety of bits from 8 bit to 32-bit. The most common is UTF-8, which can include every character set for every language and then some (including emoji). To learn more, see the [description from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description). \n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 is Unicode by default. Which is why we have no trouble doing something like: \n",
    "~~~ python \n",
    "print(\"Waves to class 👋!\")\n",
    "~~~ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Note 2. Strings are really a special kind of a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn more about lists next. But strings are just a special kind of list - one with only characters in the same encoding. This means we can do things with strings like we can with a list, like sort the strings, or ask for elements 3 through 10. But because strings are special, they have their own unique [methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-method-function-python/), like ```upper()``` which turns the lower-case letters to upper case.  \n",

    "### Note 1. Dictionaries are not ordered, even if it seems like it. \n",
    "Chances are the above example printed the items in the order that you entered them in the dictionary. But this is not always the case, especially for large dictionaries. This is because dictionaries use a technique called __hashing__, whereby the map the values directly on to values in memory. So when you pass it a key it knows exactly the area of memory to look for the value. This is as fast as it gets fo retrieval. It's different for say finding a value in a list. The list has to read through all the values to get to the one you are looking for. This ability to directly access a value regardless of it's location. It is the same principle as __Random Access Memory__.  The problem is, it can't preserve both the order and the property of random memory access. So we have lists which are ordered and  dictionaries which are fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some programs, like ```javascript``` have the notion of an __associative array__ which has both an order and can be accessed by random access. Python does not natively have such a feature, but as we will see later, we can use a __series__ to accomplish precisely this (ordered and random acccess)."
